# PCQNG Temporal RNG Research Brief
**Python Port Canonical Fidelity Analysis & Implementation Issues**

## Executive Summary

This brief documents the reverse engineering and Python porting of PCQNG (PC Quantum Number Generator), a temporal jitter-based random number generator from ME Trainer 2020. The audit exposed fundamental implementation flaws masked by reward-hacking tests, revealing deep issues with timing source adaptation and statistical distribution preservation.

### 2. Original Hardware Characteristics

**Timing Source**: 
- RDTSC (Read Time-Stamp Counter) - CPU cycle counter
- Resolution: ~0.3ns per increment (@3.3GHz)
- Jitter source: CPU scheduling, cache misses, interrupts, thermal effects

**Expected Timing Distribution**:
- Natural jitter range: hundreds to low thousands of cycles
- Mean timing differences: ~130-400 cycles typical
- Outliers: up to 10,000+ cycles during interrupts/context switches

## Python Port Implementation

### 3. Timing Source Adaptation Challenge

**Problem**: RDTSC (CPU cycles) → `time.perf_counter_ns()` (nanoseconds)
- Original: Integer cycles, hardware-specific calibration
- Port: Nanosecond floating-point, OS-abstracted monotonic timer

**Empirical Measurements** (Windows 10, Intel):
```
Natural timing differences (no artificial delays):
Mean: 281.0 ns
Std: ~150-300 ns  
Min: 100 ns
Max: 2,700 ns (with occasional outliers)
Range: Typically 100-3,000 ns
```

**Calibration Strategy Implemented**:
```python
# Auto-calibrate divisor during 1000-sample ramp phase
mean_lpf = sum(ramp_samples) / 1000
self._q_divisor = 128.0  # Target eBits ≈ 128 for typical timing
```

### 4. Statistical Distribution Requirements

**Scott Wilber Bias Amplification Doctrine**:
- Preserve natural timing bias, don't flatten to uniform
- Micro-intentional effects should influence timing distribution
- Non-uniformity is a feature, not a bug

**Expected eBits Characteristics**:
- Range: 0-255 (8-bit quantized timing differences)
- Distribution: Non-uniform (intentionally biased)
- Chi-square test: p < 0.05 indicates preserved bias (desired)

## Critical Implementation Issues Discovered

### 5. Reward Hacking in Original Tests

**Issue 1: Artificial Timing Inflation**
```python
# WRONG: Artificial delays mask calibration problems
time.sleep(0.0001)  # Creates ~100,000ns timing differences
# vs natural timing ~100-3,000ns
```

**Issue 2: State Machine Counting Error**
- Expected: 3 INIT processing steps per canon
- Original test assumed: 4 steps (including timestamp setup)
- Root cause: Confusion between setup vs processing phases

**Issue 3: Statistical Expectation Errors**
- Test expected: Mean eBits = 130.7 (from original hardware)
- Reality: Port requires recalibration for nanosecond timing
- Failure: All eBits = 255 (clamped due to wrong divisor)

### 6. Empirical Audit Results

**Before Fix** (with artificial delays):
```
timing_diff: 653,500 ns (0.65ms artificial sleep)
q_factor: 1,266 ns
eBits calculation: 653,500 / 1,266 = 516 → clamped to 255
Result: All eBits = 255 (broken distribution)
```

**After Fix** (natural timing):
```
PCQNG calibrated: mean_lpf=805.6, divisor=128.0
Natural timing differences: 100-3,000 ns
q_factor: 805.6 / 128 = 6.3 ns
eBits range: 16-476 → reasonable byte distribution
```

**LFSR Behavior Validation**:
```python
# Correct behavior with alternating input:
Initial state: 0x2aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Step 0: bit=0, state=0x5555555555555555  
Step 1: bit=1, state=0x2aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
# LFSR oscillates correctly with constant input
# Multiple states observed with varying input
```

### 7. Remaining Research Questions

**Question 1: Optimal Divisor Calibration**
- Current: Fixed divisor = 128.0
- Alternative: Dynamic calibration based on observed timing variance
- Trade-off: Stability vs adaptation to different hardware

**Question 2: Natural Timing Distribution Preservation**
- Challenge: Modern OS timing vs original bare-metal RDTSC
- Issue: Less micro-timing variance in abstracted timing APIs
- Potential solution: Multiple timing sources, CPU affinity, priority elevation

**Question 3: Bias Amplification Validation**
- How to quantitatively measure "micro-intentional bias"?
- Statistical tests beyond chi-square for bias detection?
- Calibration that preserves bias while ensuring reasonable range?

**Question 4: Cross-Platform Timing Characteristics**
```
Windows 10: mean=281ns, range=100-2,700ns
Linux: TBD
macOS: TBD
```

### 8. Test Suite Failures Still Under Investigation

**Packet Generation Issue**:
```
Error: Only 2 unique corrected bytes, expected >10
Unique bytes: {42, 85}
```

**Hypothesis**: LFSR not receiving sufficient input variation
- Natural timing produces limited eBits range
- LFSR correction insufficient to create byte diversity
- May need: longer collection period, different LFSR seeding, or input preprocessing

## Research Consultation Requests

## Conclusion

The PCQNG port successfully replicates core temporal RNG mechanics but faces fundamental challenges in timing source adaptation. The audit exposed significant reward hacking in initial tests and identified the critical importance of natural timing jitter preservation. Further research is needed to optimize the balance between canonical fidelity and modern platform constraints.

**Priority**: Resolve packet generation diversity issue while maintaining Scott Wilber bias amplification doctrine compliance.

prev = time.perf_counter_ns()
for i in range(1000):
    curr = time.perf_counter_ns()
    timing_diffs.append(curr - prev)
    prev = curr
```

```
Sample Size: 1,000 measurements
Mean: 281.0 ns
Standard Deviation: ~250 ns
Min: 100 ns  
Max: 2,700 ns
Median: ~200 ns

- 99% of values: 100-2,000 ns
- Outliers (>2,000 ns): ~1% (context switching/interrupts)
```

### A2. Calibration Formula Evolution

**Original Hardware Formula**:
```
qFactor = LPF_value / 33333.0
eBits = round(timing_diff / qFactor)
Target: eBits mean ≈ 130.7
```

**Port Calibration Attempts**:

**Attempt 1** (Failed - Wrong divisor):
```python
self._q_divisor = typical_timing / 128.0  # ~2.2
Result: qFactor ≈ 360, eBits > 1000 → all clamped to 255
```

**Attempt 2** (Failed - Over-compensation):
```python  
self._q_divisor = 128.0 * 4.0  # 512.0
Result: qFactor ≈ 1.6, eBits > 1000 → all clamped to 255
```

**Attempt 3** (Working):
```python
self._q_divisor = 128.0  # Fixed target
Result: qFactor ≈ 6.3, eBits range 16-476 → reasonable distribution
```

### A3. State Machine Validation Data

**Canonical Progression Measurement**:
```
Step 0: state=INIT, result=None, proc_counter=0
Step 1: state=INIT, result=None, proc_counter=1  
Step 2: state=INIT, result=None, proc_counter=2
Step 3: state=RAMP, result=None, proc_counter=0
...
Step 1002: state=RAMP, result=None, proc_counter=999
Step 1003: state=NORMAL, result=None, proc_counter=0 (transition step)
Step 1004: state=NORMAL, result=42, proc_counter=1 (first output)
```

**Timing**: Complete state machine cycle: ~1.5 seconds (natural timing)

### A4. LFSR Behavior Analysis

**State Evolution with Alternating Input**:
```
Initial: 0x2aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Input=0: 0x5555555555555555
Input=1: 0x2aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  
Input=0: 0x5555555555555555
Input=1: 0x2aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

With 100 alternating inputs: 2 unique states observed
With varying inputs: >10 unique states observed
```

**Polynomial Effectiveness**:
- Taps: [0, 13, 30, 37, 48] into 63-bit register
- Period: Theoretical 2^63-1 (maximal length sequence)
- Observed: Proper state evolution with varied input
